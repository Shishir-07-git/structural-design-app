\# 🧠 Structural Design App



This web-based engineering assistant helps civil and structural engineers perform essential design calculations for:



\- 🏗 Beam Design  

\- 🏛 Column Design  

\- 🧱 Slab Design  

\- 🦶 Foundation Design  



The app calculates:

\- Bending moment, shear force, and reinforcement (Ast)

\- Deflection and shear checks

\- Biaxial column interaction checks

\- Slab design (one-way and two-way)

\- Footing design with area, shear, and reinforcement checks



It follows standard design principles from IS 456 / NBC Nepal and is built using \*\*Streamlit\*\*.



\## 🚀 Run Locally
